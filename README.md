## The effect of attachment barriers on X exponent in irreversible submonolayer growth
+ This code [KineticMonteCarloSimulationShortRangeInteraction](ShortRangeInteractionKMC.c) is developed by me with help of prof. J.G. Amar (my Ph.D. advisor). This is KMC implementation to study the effect of attachment barriers on the chi (x) exponent. Sameer has analysize the results and prepared the manuscript for publications. 
+ This work has been published in [surface science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039602821001424).

+ The graph shows the island distribution during submololayer growth at different attachment barrier. 
+ [squaren](squaren.c) gives square island into graphical form as shown in above figure.
